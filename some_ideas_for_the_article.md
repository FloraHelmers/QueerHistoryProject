First point is defining the queer identities which are diverses. 
In the forum Munchen project an idea was proposed to keep the definitions clear. 
#schema 
The person is male, female, transgender male, transgender female. This enable
to make a difference between gender and sex without having it mandatory. 
The notion of avatar emerges especially in drag shows but it is important to mention. 



# The ontology
The goal of an ontology in general 
    (help gather different elements), organize them in different ways
Creation based on research and the wikimedia commons for the easiest things
The advantages of our ontology
    gender is correlated with sex without saying it (using the removing NA project)
        sexual orientations : already defined (cf flags, cf pansexual)
    a focus on art and collaborations 
        the notion of avatar is present (cf dragshows, David Bowie)
        the associations and venues, organized by ? 
    the concept of influence 
        a song is played in some club (I'll survive ...)
        The characters in films or book (read by )
        where the piece of art are accessed 

This first version is very based on the LGBTQ+ scene of the 1980s and the representation of queer people and the development of a global queer culture. It can be better. For instance, by going further in the past (Bagdad ) with a greater focus on the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the law. 
To go further in a less eurocentric point of view, a way could be to explore the different terms defining genders depending on the country : gives access to other cultures, like the Bugis society where a third gender exists for priests and shamans.

The next step would have been to populate it. 

# The link with wikidata
One way to populate the ontology. Queer people, etc. 
But of course the  concept of influence is not present (needs NLP analysis of interviews etc)



Partie ontologie : 
first getting an overview, then populating using the sparql requests.
Different elements from the queer culture such as bars and clubs. But one point is that the bars didn't consider themselves as LGBTQ+. 
So the idea would be to get from texts testimonies. 

reference to research on queer history made by historians.
